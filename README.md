Multilayered Digital Image Encryption Approach to Resist Cryptographic Attacks for Cybersecurity

This repository contains the implementation of a robust, multilayered digital image encryption technique designed to enhance cybersecurity by resisting various cryptographic attacks. The approach employs multiple layers of encryption, combining traditional and modern cryptographic methods to ensure high security and integrity of digital images.

Key Features:

Multilayered Encryption: Utilizes a combination of pixel shuffling, substitution, and transformation techniques to create multiple layers of security.

Resistance to Attacks: Designed to withstand common cryptographic attacks such as brute force, differential, and statistical attacks.

High Security: Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of digital images.

Efficient Performance: Optimized algorithms for fast encryption and decryption processes without compromising security.

Applications:

*  Secure transmission of sensitive images over untrusted networks.

*  Protection of digital assets in cybersecurity applications.

*  Enhanced privacy in image storage and sharing platforms.

Technologies Used:

*  Python

*  OpenCV (for image processing)

*  Cryptographic libraries (e.g., PyCryptodome)

Getting Started:
